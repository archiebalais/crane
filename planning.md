# Planning Out Crane.

## About:

Crane is a social media application that allows users to craft posts, join flocks and interact with one another. My inspirations for crane's functionality came from reddit and facebook.

Some Terminology:
- Flock - Group
- Wing(s) - basically upvotes and downvotes.

## User Stories:

### Authenication:

#### As a non-authenicated user:
- I can view the site's public content.
- I can to search for public content and users within the site get results.
- I can signup for an account.
- I cannot upvote or comment on posts without logging in.

#### As an authenicated user:
- I can create posts, flocks and interact with followers.
- I can add wings / subtract wings from posts and comments.
- I can comment on posts and comments.
- I can choose wither my posts are public or private.
- I can be either a member or an admin of a flock.
- I can create collections of flocks and posts.
